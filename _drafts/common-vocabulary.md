Somewhat strangely for a Dota article I'll start with a discussion about two other games, Magic The Gathering and
Hearthstone :smile:

Magic The Gathering (MTG for short) is a popular trading card game. In it you gather resources called lands which later
on allow you to play creatures and spells which you use to beat up your opponent. It's quite complex, there are a
million cards you have to buy and they can be [quite
expensive](http://www.quicktoptens.com/top-tens/entertainment/gaming/top-10-expensive-magic-gathering-cards). Who am I
kidding, they can be incredibly expensive! If you don't believe me click that link and look at the top 10. Number 10
starts at $700. Number 1 goes from $1500 to $3000. Here it is in case you want to see how it looks like:

Anyway, because the game can be so expensive, even though I knew people playing MTG and even despite the fact that I
liked the game concept, I did not start playing. I try to avoid games which are major money sinks. I do like time sinks!

Instead, I started playing Hearthstone, which is basically a simplified, digital MTG. Also called jokingly "Wizard
Poker". The game's tutorial even has you playing the <s>wizard</s> mage:

<sub>*Yes, that's Jaina Proudmoore aka "Crystal Maiden" from back in the Warcraft/Dota 1 universe, for you
old-timers*</sub>

Anyway, getting back on track. The guys designing MTG are quite smart and they publish articles about MTG on their site.
One of their articles has been very influential. It's called [Timmy, Johnny and
Spike](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b). Who are Timmy and Johnny and Spike
and what do they have to do with Dota?

Well, I think that they're relevant to almost any kind of competitive game.

The reason they are relevant is because they describe player types, player personalities. In MTG's case they are used as
sort of personas which represent the types of players the MTG designers target when they create new cards.

So, why are they relevant?

### Timmy

I'll start with Timmy. Timmy is basically the kind of player that likes to crush his opponent. Timmy likes to win by
destroying his opponents. To put it into Dota terms, he wants to destroy your base with his fully farmed Anti Mage.
He'll even head back to the woods to farm his 6th item so that his "suit" is sparkling when he's destroying your throne.

We've all had these kinds of players in our games.

<sub>Yes, he really needed to get the 6th heart in order to win the game!</sub>

 I think they're actually the majority of Dota players. And when I said that these
player personas are visibile in most competitive games, I wasn't kidding. If you've ever played Starcraft 1/2 and you've
played "15 mins no rush" games against someone who wanted to attack you with 15 battlecruisers, you've also met Timmy
over there.
