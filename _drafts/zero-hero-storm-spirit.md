title: "From Zero to Hero: Rai'jin, the Storm Spirit"
---

Hello folks, I'm oblio and I'll be your host for this very first episode of "Dota History: From Zero to Hero", a series 
about the history of Dota heroes. In this series we'll talk about the evolution of our favorite heroes from the version 
in which they were introduced up to the current version we all love or hate today. Along the way I'll be highlighting 
key points in their evolution, reasons behind their introduction (where possible, as you know, Icefrog, Dota's 
maintainer is notoriously reclusive) and some of the most interesting moments related to these heroes.

So, let's get started. Our first hero is one of the most slippery ones out there, Storm Spirit.

**Raijin, the Storm Spirit**, as he was named in Dota, was introduced in patch 6.44, on [insert date] 2005, as part of a huge content patch, together with 5 other heroes which have shaped modern Dota, as we know it. The other 5? Dark Seer, Undying, Huskar, Pit Lord and [insert 6th hero]. We will talk about the others in future "From Zero to Hero" episodes.

Storm Spirit (abbreviated "SS") was introduced to fill a very narrow niche at the time, that of the Intelligence (Int) core, or "carry"/"right clicker" as it was known at the time. His only direct competitors at the time were Obsidian Destroyer (rather unpopular and somewhat considered underpowered for the competitive scene), Silencer (considered situational) and Enchantress (too good early game to actually be used as a core, despite decent right click potential). Storm was meant to fill the gap and provide solid right click power and decent survivability in an Int package.

Let's go through his stats at the time of introduction:
- [insert base HP and Str, Str gain]
- [insert base damage and Int, Int gain]
- [insert range]
As you can see, the "chassis" was nothing out of the ordinary, but still solid. So let's move on to the really interesting part, his skill set:

- Overload: yes, it is basically Wisp's current skill, minus the HP drain; Overload was meant to be Storm's first steroid skill, a way for him to greatly increase his attack speed at the cost of a continued mana usage; when leveled up it provided a solid DPS increase for our spirit friend
- Overcharge: similar to today's overcharge except for 2 aspects: one, it triggered once every [insert # of attacks], secondly it purged the target; the synergy with Overload is obvious as yo could trigger it a lot once Overload was leveled up; this skill was the "sleeper hit" in Storm's original skill set as his creators underestimated the effects of an AOE nuke + purge; the first iteration could purge basically everything making many heroes which relied on buffs completely useless (Sven and Broodmother come to mind, for their ulties); when coupled with any Vacuum-like effect 1-2 procs of Overcharge could be quite devastating, which was worrying for a passive, non ultimate skill on a ranged hero
- [insert mana shield name]: quite underrated at the time, this skill, which was also castable on allies [to check in-game] provided Storm decent survivability against nukes; nothing to write home about, but still solid
- Grappling Hook [check name]: Storm's original ulti and the hardest thing to understand about the original hero; it served as a pseudo blink/escape skill or team initiation skill in either direction: either solo initiation or dragging an ally with a solid initiation along or even possible blink + Grapple enemies in, a la Batrider blink + Lasso; when I said that it was hard to understand, I meant it was hard to actually see the role of this skill considering Storm's skill set: as a solo initiation tool it was mis-placed on a hero without huge AOE or solid lockdown (Overcharge's purge not cutting it in an age of solid stuns), as a team initiation tool while dragging an ally it was decent but not being instant made it lackluster, as initiation by pulling an enemy it required itemization not really benefiting the mana-hungry, damage-wanting Int hero (since this required Blink Dagger or at least a dubious Shadowblade (Lothar's Edge)) and even worse, turned the would be carry into kamikaze a la Venge, hardly a role you want your 10000 gold core to be in

Despite a rather haphazard mishmash of skills, the Dota community adopted Storm, at least outside the competitive scene (this version was never used in the competitive scene). The allure of massive attack speed proved too strong and many a Storm died bravely fighting Trolls and various invisible monsters while wielding Daedalus (Buriza) and Divine Rapier. Yours truly liked the hero and used him as a more utility oriented, rat-like creature with items such as Necronomicon, using the Grapple and Barrier [?] as escape skills.

Still, when the novelty factor wore off and the initial ridiculous values from release were nerfed (purge effect and AOE for Overcharge, attack range, base damage), Storm could be considered one of the less popular heroes in Dota. And as we will discover, his 5 brothers from release didn't fare much better, except for pub darling Huskar.
