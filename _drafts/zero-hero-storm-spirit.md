title: "From Zero to Hero: Rai'jin, the Storm Spirit"
---

Hello folks, I'm *oblio* and I'll be your host for a new series about Dota: "Dota History: From Zero to Hero". In this
series I'll talk about the evolution of Dota heroes from the date they were introduced up to the present day.

You can follow the series through the Youtube videos or by reading the articles on this site.

Dota's history is something that hasn't been covered so far and it can be hard to piece it together from information
scattered on the internet. At the same time the creator of modern Dota, Icefrog, is notoriously reclusive so first-hand
information is even harder to get. As a result I will not be able to present the reasons for creating a specific Dota
hero. But apart from that I will follow the key points of the hero evolution leading to the version we're currently
playing.

So, let's start!

### Storm Spirit

**Raijin, the Storm Spirit** was introduced in patch 6.44, on the 3rd of June 2005, as part of a huge content patch.
This patch also contained 5 other heroes which have shaped modern Dota. The other 5? 

* Dark Seer
* Undying
* Huskar
* Templar Assasin 
* aaaand Pit Lord (the fabled Dota 1 hero we are still waiting for in Dota 2 :worried:)

We will talk about the others in future "From Zero to Hero" episodes.

Storm Spirit (*SS* for short) was introduced to fill a very narrow niche at the time, that of the Intelligence (Int)
core, or *carry / right clicker* as it was known at the time. His only direct competitors at the time were:

* Obsidian Destroyer<sup>TM Blizzard</sup> aka Outworld Devourer (underpowered at the time)
* Silencer (considered too situational) 
* Enchantress (too good early game to actually be used as a core, despite having decent right click potential)

Storm was meant to be a more adaptable Int core which would provide solid right click power and decent survivability.

Let's go through his stats at the time of introduction:
![Storm Spirit stats at launch](/images/posts/zero-hero-storm-spirit/storm-stats-6.44.png)

So:

* 600 range
* 45-55 base damage
* 568 base HP
* 310 movement speed (MS)
* 1.7 base attack time (BAT)
* 22 base Strength (Str), 2.5 Str gain per level
* 1.7 Agility (Agi) + 1.1 Agi gain per level
* 2.3 Int + 2.6 Int gain per level

As you can see, the "chassis" was nothing out of the ordinary, but still solid. 

So let's move on to the really interesting part, his skill set:

### Electric Rave
![Storm's first skill](/images/posts/zero-hero-storm-spirit/electric-rave-6.44.png)

In case it seems somewhat similar, yes, it is basically Wisp's Overload, minus the HP drain. Keep in mind that Wisp was
introduced much later than Storm Spirit so he didn't exist at the time, neither did Overload. So it was the other way
around than what you previously though, it was actually Wisp who copied Storm's old skill :smile:

Electric Rave was meant to be Storm's first steroid skill, a way for him to greatly increase his attack speed at the
cost of a continued mana usage; when leveled up it provided a solid DPS increase for our spirit friend.

Back when Storm was still new it was said that you could see if the Storm player was inexperienced by his leveling up of
Electric Rave first.

### Barrier
![Storm's second skill](/images/posts/zero-hero-storm-spirit/barrier-6.44.png)

I think this skill might seem a little bit similar to another skill you know from another hero. And the same thing
happened here as well. Ember Spirit's Flame Guard was inspired by this skill. The old Barrier did not do AOE magic
damage, it just absorbed it, as its name suggests. Also, unlike its newer cousin, it was targetable so you could cast it
on allies.

All-in-all, nothing to write home about, but still a solid skill.

![Storm's third skill](/images/posts/zero-hero-storm-spirit/overload-6.44.png)

Now we're on somewhat more familiar territory. The old Overload was similar to today's except for 2 aspects: 

* it triggered once every 8/7/6/5 attacks instead of triggering after spell cast
* it slowed and dispelled (purged) the target instead of just slowing it

The synergy with Electric Rave is obvious as you could trigger Overload a lot once Electriv Rave was leveled up. This
skill was the "sleeper hit" in Storm's original skill set as Storm's creator underestimated the effect of a spammable
AOE nuke combined with a purge.

In the initial version, 6.44, this skill could purge basically everything making many heroes which relied on buffs
completely useless (Sven and Broodmother ulties, which at the time were dispelable). When coupled with any Vacuum-like
effect 1-2 procs of Overcharge could be quite devastating, which was worrying for a passive, non ultimate skill on a
ranged hero.

### Lightning Grapple 

![Storm's ulti](/images/posts/zero-hero-storm-spirit/lightning-grapple-6.44.png)

Storm's original ulti and the hardest thing to understand about the original hero. It could serve as a:

* pseudo blink/escape skill 
* team initiation skill in either direction: either solo initiation or dragging n ally with a solid initiation along or
  even possible blink + Grapple enemies in, a la Batrider blink + Lasso

When I said that it was hard to understand, I meant it was hard to actually see the role of this skill in Storm's overall
skill set. 

As a solo initiation tool it was mis-placed on a hero without huge AOE or solid lockdown, Overload's purge
not cutting it in an age of solid stuns.

As a team initiation tool when used to carry an ally it was decent but because it wasn't instant it was lackluster in this
role (it had a travel speed similar to today's Ball Lightining).

As initiation for pulling an enemy out of position it required itemization not really benefiting the mana-hungry,
damage-wanting Int hero (since this required Blink Dagger or at least a dubious Shadowblade aka Lothar's Edge<sup>TM
Blizzard</sup>) and even worse, turned the would be carry into kamikaze similar to Vengeful Spirit, hardly a role you
want your 10000 gold core to be in.

Despite a rather haphazard mishmash of skills, the Dota community adopted Storm, at least outside the competitive scene
(this version was never used in the competitive scene). The allure of massive attack speed proved too strong and many a
Storm died bravely fighting Trolls and various invisible monsters while wielding Daedalus (Buriza) and Divine Rapier.
Yours truly liked the hero and used him as a more utility oriented, rat-like creature with items such as Necronomicon,
using Lightning Grapple and Barrier as escape skills.

Still, when the novelty factor wore off and the initial ridiculous factors was removed (Overload purging its targets),
Storm could be considered one of the less popular heroes in Dota. And as we will discover later on in this series, his 5
brothers from release didn't fare much better, except for pub darling Huskar.
