Hello there! :smile:

My name is Oblio and I will be your host on dota.oblio360.com.

I am an "old school Dota player": I've started to play Dota 1 in 2005.
Since then I've played thousands and thousands of Dota 1 and Dota 2 games and I've followed the competitive scene avidly,
from the early days of Warcraft 3 replays without casting to the modern days of Twitch streams, DotaTV and Youtube videos.

I've always been interested in the intricate details that make Dota what it is, and it Dota's evolution.

On this blog I will try to present Dota's evolution, how I perceived and hopefully how others have seen it as well.

Enjoy your visit and if you'd like you can contact me by:
